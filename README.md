This is mini project for findin the shortest path in yangon Using Dijkstra's algorithm. If you want any node pleace change the array list of the node and edge.
This contain to search for undirected graph.
It is written using (HTML,CSS and Javascript).

Here to manage the node of the graph:

Here to manage the edges between node, and you need to add biredirection edge for each.

After Searching two node , the system can find the shortest path between route.
